If      for some reason this is required, please delete the key first,      then reupload.</p> </li> <li> <p>Is ssh using the correct key? You can check which keys are being      found and offered by ssh using <code>ssh -vvv</code>. If your private key has      a non-default name you can use the <code>-i</code> flag to provide it to ssh,      i.e. <code>ssh -i path/to/key username@tursa.dirac.ed.ac.uk</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Are you entering the passphrase correctly? You will be asked for      your private key's passphrase first. If you enter it incorrectly      you will usually be asked to enter it again, and usually up to      three times in total, after which ssh will fail with <code>Permission      denied (publickey)</code>. If you would like to confirm your passphrase      without attempting to connect, you can use <code>ssh-keygen -y -f      /path/to/private/key</code>. If successful, this command will print the      corresponding public key. You can also use this to check it is the      one uploaded to SAFE.</p> </li> <li> <p>Are permissions correct on the ssh key? One common issue is that      the permissions are incorrect on the either the key file, or the      directory it's contained in. On Linux/MacOS for example, if your      private keys are held in <code>~/.ssh/</code> you can check this with <code>ls -al      ~/.ssh</code>. This should give something similar to the following      output:</p> <pre><code> $ ls -al ~/.ssh/\n drwx------.  2 user group    48 Jul 15 20:24 .\n drwx------. 12 user group  4096 Oct 13 12:11 ..\n -rw-------.  1 user group   113 Jul 15 20:23 authorized_keys\n -rw-------.  1 user group 12686 Jul 15 20:23 id_rsa\n -rw-r--r--.  1 user group  2785 Jul 15 20:23 id_rsa.pub\n -rw-r--r--.  1 user group  1967 Oct 13 14:11 known_hosts\n</code></pre> <p>The important section here is the string of letters and dashes at  the start, for the lines ending in <code>.</code>, <code>id_rsa</code>, and  <code>id_rsa.pub</code>, which indicate permissions on the containing  directory, private key, and public key respectively. If your  permissions are not correct, they can be set with <code>chmod</code>. Consult  the table below for the relevant <code>chmod</code> command. On Windows,  permissions are handled differently but can be set by  right-clicking on the file and selecting Properties &gt; Security &gt;  Advanced. The user, SYSTEM, and Administrators should have <code>Full  control</code>, and no other permissions should exist for both public  and private key files, and the containing folder.</p> </li> </ul> Target Permissions <code>chmod</code> Code Directory <code>drwx------</code> 700 Private Key <code>-rw-------</code> 600 Public Key <code>-rw-r--r--</code> 644 <p><code>chmod</code> can be used to set permissions on the target in the following way: <code>chmod &lt;code&gt; &lt;target&gt;</code>. So for example to set correct permissions on the private key file <code>id_rsa_Tursa</code> one would use the command <code>chmod 600 id_rsa_Tursa</code>.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>Unix file permissions can be understood in the following way. There are three groups that can have file permissions: (owning) users, (owning) groups, and others. The available permissions are read, write, and execute. The first character indicates whether the target is a file <code>-</code>, or directory <code>d</code>. The next three characters indicate the owning user's permissions. The first character is <code>r</code> if they have read permission, <code>-</code> if they don't, the second character is <code>w</code> if they have write permission, <code>-</code> if they don't, the third character is <code>x</code> if they have execute permission, <code>-</code> if they don't. This pattern is then repeated for group, and other permissions. For example the pattern <code>-rw-r--r--</code> indicates that the owning user can read and write the file, members of the owning group can read it, and anyone else can also read it. The <code>chmod</code> codes are constructed by treating the user, group, and owner permission strings as binary numbers, then converting them to decimal. For example the permission string <code>-rwx------</code> becomes <code>111 000 000</code> -&gt; <code>700</code>.</p>"},{"location":"tursa-user-guide/connecting/#ssh-verbose-output","title":"SSH verbose output","text":"<p>Verbose debugging output from <code>ssh</code> can be very useful for diagnosing the issue.

If you try to use older versions of OpenMPI via modules on Tursa you will see errors when using <code>srun</code>. The old modules are only kept for backwards compatibility, you should always compile and run software using OpenMPI 4.1.5 or newer if possible.</p> <p>If you are running parallel jobs, your job submission script should contain one or more srun commands to launch the parallel executable across the compute nodes. In most cases you will want to add the following options to <code>srun</code>:</p> <ul> <li><code>--nodes=[number of nodes]</code> - Set the number of compute nodes for this job step</li> <li><code>--ntasks-per-node=[MPI processes per node]</code> - This will usually be <code>4</code> for GPU jobs    as you usually have 1 MPI process per GPU</li> <li><code>--cpus-per-task=[stride between MPI processes]</code> - This will usually be either <code>8</code>    (for A100-40 nodes) or <code>12</code> (for A100-80 nodes). If you are using the <code>gpu</code> QoS    where you can get any type of GPU node, you will usually se this to <code>8</code>.</li> <li><code>--distribution=block:block</code> - do not use hyperthreads/SMP</li> <li><code>--hint=nomultithread</code>- the first <code>block</code> means use a block distribution    of processes across nodes (i.e. fill nodes before moving onto the next one) and    the second <code>block</code> means use a block distribution of processes across \"sockets\"    within a node (i.e. fill a \"socket\" before moving on to the next one).</li> </ul> <p>Important</p> <p>The Slurm definition of a \"socket\" does not usually correspond to a physical CPU socket. On Tursa GPU nodes it corresponds to half the cores on a socket as the GPU nodes are configured with NPS2.</p> <p>On the Tursa CPU nodes, the Slurm definition of a scoket does correspond to a physical CPU socket (64 cores) as the COU nodes are configured with NPS1.</p>"},{"location":"tursa-user-guide/scheduler/#example-job-submission-scripts","title":"Example job submission scripts","text":"<p>The typical strategy for submitting josb on Tursa is for the batch script to  request full nodes with no process/thread pinning and then the individual  <code>srun</code> commands set the correct options for dividing up processes and threads across nodes.</p>"},{"location":"tursa-user-guide/scheduler/#example-job-submission-script-for-a-parallel-job-using-cuda","title":"Example: job submission script for a parallel job using CUDA","text":"<p>A job submission script for a parallel job that uses 4 compute nodes, 4 MPI processes per node and 4 GPUs per node.
